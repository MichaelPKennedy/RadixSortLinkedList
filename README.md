# RadixSortLinkedList
This program uses arrays of singly linked lists to perform a radix sort on a list of 1 million nodes with random integer key values. It then prints out the time in milliseconds that the sort took to run. This is all done in MainProgram.java. The singly linked list class used is found in SinglyLinkedListInteger.java.
